    <b>The basic of Web and HTML</b>
<p>Overview of the Internet
There are three components as to how an individual interacts with the internet:<br>
1. The computer/Browser: A program that allows your computer to display files found on the web
<br>
2. The internet: The world's largest network (often described as a cloud)
<br>
3. Servers: Computers that host the files that make up the web
<br>
All of these are interconnected by <b>HTTP</b> or Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
Each file, or web page is a text document written in HTML, HyperText Markup Language. 
Browsers will in turn interpret HTML. This is made up of:<br>
- Text content<br>
- Mark up<br>
- Reference to other documents, eg. videos, images,...<br>
- Links<br></p>

<p><b>HTML Vocabulary</b><br>
In order for the computer to understand the language one uses coding. Three key terms where presented during the introductory class. 
<br><b>1. HTML Tags</b>:is always contained within angled brackets and are composed of an <em>opening tag</em> and a <em>closing tag</em>.
Though they are invisible on the Web page they are key. It is always contained within angled brackets. 
When they do not have a closing tag they are are called a <em>void tag</em>. 
This applies to images or line breaks. 
<br><b>2. HTML Element</b>: Is what is called all that is between the HTML tags.
<br><b>3. HTML Attibute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element, and is expressed inbetween brackets as href. 
For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL <href>www.udacity.com</href>   
</p>

<p><b>Inline vs. Block</b><br>
An <b>inline</b> tag groups content but not in box. Examples of such tags are:<br>
- b: bold<br>
- em: emphasis (italics)<br>
- br: break<br>
- strong<br>
- image (img)<br>
- span<br>
<br>
A <b>block</b> not only groups content, but also makes an invisible box around it. Examples are:<br>
- p: paragraph<br>
- form<br>
- div<br></p>

<p><b>The structure of a HTML document</b><br>
Step 1 - Type of document <br>
Step 2-  Title of document including meta-data (java script, CSS,)
<br>Step 3 - Body, includes content
<br>Step 4 - End
